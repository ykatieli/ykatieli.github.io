            <span class="subheading">(Incoming) Executive Co-Director, Nov 2018-Present <br>Marketing/Logistics Coordinator, Nov 2017-Nov 2018</span>

            <p>Each year, 400-500 students participate in Cornell's flagship hackathon to ideate, design, and build cool projects. I will be leading ~30 students across 7 teams(Marketing, Logistics, Finance, Sponsorship, Web Development, Design, Research & Development) to organize Cornell's largest hackathon. </p>

            <p>I participated in BigRed//Hacks Fall 2017, and my team made a cool project (that also won some prizes). Learn more about it <a href="projects.html">here</a> under BigRedNotes.</p>

            <span class="subheading">Autopilot Subteam Member, Sept 2017-Present</span>

            <p>The Autopilot subteam is responsible for ensuring that the aircraft can perform all necessary maneuvers to fulfill the mission requirements. This involves configuring and tuning the autopilot for each of our aircrafts, as well as implementing software to aid in autonomous flight planning, which includes our autopilot ground station and path planning algorithms. The Autopilot subteam is constantly evaluating all autopilot systems available to determine which will perform best for us. (you can check out some of the projects that I've been working on <a href="projects.html">here</a>.)</p>

            <p>CUAir is an interdisciplinary undergraduate research project team that designs, builds, and flies an autonomous aerial vehicle capable of autonomous takeoff and landing, waypoint navigation, obstacle avoidance, target detection, dropping an autonomous ground vehicle for search and rescue, and more.</p>

            <p>In 2018, CUAir won 1st place amongst fixed wing aircrafts in the International AUVSI SUAS competition.</p>

            <span class="subheading">Co-Founder, Director of Operations, Mar 2015-Aug 2016</span>

            <p>My sophomore year of high school, I co-founded SecondGen, an international youth organization with 3 other teen entrepreneurs. This idea spurred from the 2015 Dallas Regional Science and Engineering Fair, when my friends and I noticed that our school was too large, and although our school had so many talented students, they weren't collaborating with fellow creators simply because they didn't know of each other (yet). We created SecondGen with the goal to connect students in the North Dallas suburb community who were interested in art, music, film, business, and technology. Soon, SecondGen expanded to other parts of Texas, over the nation, and internationally. Through SecondGen, students created a hub for collaboration, and worked on creative projects, hosted events, and organized hackathons together. As of the end of 2016, SecondGen had over 1000 members located in North America, Asia, Australia, Europe, and Africa.</p>

            <p>I was one of the 4 main organizers for IncubateDFW. IncubateDFW was part of IncubateX, a teen-entrepreneurship hackathon organization that held events in 17 cities worldwide during the summer of 2016. Both IncubateX and IncubateDFW spurred out of SecondGen projects. IncubateDFW was held on various floors in the Alto 211 building in downton Dallas.</p>

            <span class="subheading">Hackathon Organizer, Dec 2015-April 2016</span>

            <p>I managed logistics and marketing for Dallas-Fort Worth’s first MLH-sponsored high school hackathon, which was hosted at my own high school. We had about ~300 attendees!</p>

            <p>I taught/coached a squad of ~10 flutes during summer band, coordinated music, planned section events with the other flute leaders, and oversaw ~100 flutes (fun tip: the <a href="http://www.keranews.org/post/getting-allens-marching-band-rose-parade-takes-8-flights-15-buses-and-12-million">Allen Eagle Escadrille</a> is the LARGEST high school marching band in the world, with over 740 members). During my senior year, I started Big Sis Lil Sis (and Bros) Gameday Themes. Flute upperclassmen were matched with underclassmen, and they were given actions/tasks to do every gameday, with the conclusion of a gift exchange at the end of the regular season.</p>
